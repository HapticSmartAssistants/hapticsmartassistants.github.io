    <h2>What is This Workshop About?</h2>
    <p>
Despite their widespread adoption, commercial smart assistant technologies have not evolved significantly in the last decade from an interaction perspective. Indeed, a user explicitly formulates a request, today using their voice, and the system attempts to respond to the userâ€™s demand. We believe that haptics have the potential to drastically shift how we interact with smart assistant technologies by offering rich, private and social interaction opportunities. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this virtual workshop, we aim to bring together experts from both auditory and haptic interaction design to 1) exchange on how the subtleties of haptics could be employed to augment or address limitations of speech-based smart assistant technologies, and 2) collaboratively imagine what it would mean to live with a general purpose purely haptic smart assistant.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through two keynote presentations and interactive explorations of these core topics, we hope to build a unifying research agenda, share ongoing work and most importantly encourage collaborations in this nascent research space.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Keynote Speakers</h3>
	<h4> Prof. Pedro Lopes, PhD - Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago </h4>
	<h4> TBD </h4>
	
    <h3>Anticipated Outcomes</h3>
    <p>
    We are planning to synthesize the emerging themes and discussions of this workshop into a collective paper. This event might furthermore become the first of a series of workshops on the theme of haptics and smart assistant technologies.
    </p>	
	
    <h3>Is this an event for me and how can I participate?</h3>
    <p>
    Absolutely! Spanning the spectrum of voice- to purely haptic-driven smart assistant interactions, we believe this workshop will offer all HAID attendees the opportunity to contribute meaningfully and most importantly learn from each other's expertise.
